# Columns Layout

![Preview](preview.png)

A design that seperates content into their own blocks. These blocks are placed side by side in a 2 column layout.

Blocks seperate the page into groups of content. Usually headings followed by the text under them.

## Notes

- This design requires a wider body but the side by side layout prevents any long line lengths. As a result, the page might look tighter.
- The design is also responsive and set columns to one on smaller devices.
