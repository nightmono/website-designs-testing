<h1>Album Design</h1>

</header>

<main>

    <h2>Is that a sideways header?</h2>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/nightmono/website-designs-testing/tree/main/designs/album">Github</a> / <a href="../../index.html">Back</a></p>

    <p>A design with a rotated page title on the left. The rest of the content is enclosed in a gray box, which is slightly shorter on its left to accommodate for the header text.</p>

    <p>The design is also responsive and works on mobile!</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>This theme is inspired from the thumbnail of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0KQNn3aL4Q">this video</a>.</li>
        <li>Unfortunately, the rotated text alignment is hard-coded and not adaptive. At least it's fixed!</li>
        <li>The gray box is not fixed (like the rotated text), which is another nitpick I have with the current design implementation.</li>
    </ul>
