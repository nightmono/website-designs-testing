# Album Design

![Preview](preview.png)

A design with a rotated page title on the left. The rest of the content is enclosed in a gray box, which is slightly shorter on its left to accommodate for the header text.

The design is also responsive and works on mobile!

## Notes

- This theme is inspired from the thumbnail of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0KQNn3aL4Q).
- Unfortunately, the rotated text alignment is hard-coded and not adaptive. At least it's fixed!
- The gray box is not fixed (like the rotated text), which is another nitpick I have with the current design implementation.
