<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This is a collection of pure HTML and CSS website designs I've crafted.</p>

<p>You can view a design by clicking on its name.</p>

<h2><a href="designs/columns/index.html">Columns</a></h2>

<img src="designs/columns/preview.png" width="auto">

<p>A design that seperates content into their own blocks. These blocks are placed side by side in a 2 column layout.</p>

<h2><a href="designs/album/index.html">Album</a></h2>

<img src="designs/album/preview.png" width="auto">

<p>A design with a rotated page title on the left. The rest of the content is enclosed in a gray box, which is slightly shorter on its left to accommodate for the header text.</p>
